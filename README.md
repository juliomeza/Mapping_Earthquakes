# Mapping Earthquakes
## Overview of Project
The graph displays all the earthquake magnitudes for a period of 7 days. The redder and larger the circle, the stronger the earthquake.
The graph also displays the tectonic plates in red lines.

## Summary
In addition to only display one-week earthquakes at the time, we can display multiple weeks over the past few years to analyze the trends.
